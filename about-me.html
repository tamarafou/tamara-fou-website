    <p>
        I'm Tamara! I grew up on sushi and ramen in Tokyo, Japan. After stuffing my face with tea, scones, and fish and chips in London for a year, I flew across the pond to New York City, which is where I'm currently at!
    </p>
    <p2>I've always been an avid traveller and have a constant yearning to see, hear, eat, and experience new places!</p2>
        
    <p3> Believe it or not, my 2016 goal was to visit a new place--country, city, part of town, anything-- every month! Sounds crazy, but so far so good! You can see how some of my journeys became a reality, <a href="./travelhacks.html"> here!</a></p3>
