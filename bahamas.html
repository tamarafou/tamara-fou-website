    <h2>Great Exuma, Bahamas</h2>
    <p>After stuffing myself with turkey and pumpkin pie, I hopped on a plane to the Bahamas. I skipped right past Nassau, where most people visit, and landed on a small island called Exuma. I didn't have much time here but you can really tell the island living is real and chill here.  </p>
        
    <h2>So here's pretty much what I did </h2>

  <div class="desc">This is one of my favourite photos I took while visiting Exuma. I know it's just a photo of driving with an open trunk but something about feeling the ocean breeze while you're crammed in the trunk with a bunch of stand-up paddleboards is exciting. </div>

  <div class="desc">Ok, so this was pretty exciting. There is a cruise that takes you about 30 minutes away from Exuma to this inhabited island where only pigs live. Obviously the point of the tour is to feed these pigs so they don't starve to death. Honestly it was quite terrifying to see HUGE pigs swimming full speed toward the boat. But here are some little piglets you can cuddle and hold if you want, they were the cutest.  </div>
