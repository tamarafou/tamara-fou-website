    <h2>Brussels in a Day</h2>
    <p1>
       My visit to Brussels, Belgium was very spontaneous, as in, I hopped on the EuroStar from London for about $80 (USD) first thing in the morning and came back the same day!It is a perfect place to visit for a day because it is a small city where you can walk around easily in.

    <h3>Eats</h3>
        <p1>To be quite honest, the soul purpose of my one day trip to Brussels was to eat as much as I can...That's right, Brussels is filled with mouth watering eats (and drinks)!</p1>
