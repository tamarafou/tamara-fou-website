    <h2><bold>Brussels in a Day</bold></h2>
    <p1>
       My visit to Brussels, Belgium was very spontaneous, as in, I hopped on the EuroStar from London for about $80 (USD) first thing in the morning and came back the same day with my friend Mark!It is a perfect place to visit for a day because it is a small city where you can walk around easily in.  
    <br/>

    <h3><bold>Eats</bold></h3>
        <p1>To be quite honest, the soul purpose of my one day trip to Brussels was to eat as much as I can...That's right, Brussels is filled with mouth watering eats (and drinks)!</p1>
        
        <h4>Waffles</h4>
        <p2>You really can not say you've been to Belgium without having a waffle. Luckily, I can say I've had two waffles. The first one I tried was from a store called <i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Brussels-Eight-and-Three-605682286208735/">Brussel Eight and Three</a></i>, which I topped with fresh whipped cream and belgian chocolate. Pretty much right after my first waffle, I stumpled into <i><a href="http://www.leonidas.com/be_en/">Leonidas</a></i>, which is one of Belgiums most globally known chocolatier's. Here, I had a caramel and banana topped waffle. </p2> 
        
        <h4>Beer</h4>
        <p2>I personally love Belgian beer because they tend to be easy to drink and fruity. My friend Mark and I did some beer tasting at the <i><a href="http://www.deliriumcafe.be/">Delirium Cafe</a></i>, which is a well known Belgian brewery. You can taste a beer for 2Euros, so we got a flight of fruity beers.  </p2>

        <h4>Other things you should try!</h4>
        <p2>I obviously went on a food tour but sometimes ya just forget to take photos but while in Brussels, you also gotta try pomme frites, which are potato fries, as well as mussel frites, which is mussels and fries. And also, lots and lots of chocolate! ;) </p2>
