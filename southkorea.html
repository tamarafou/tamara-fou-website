<h2>An Educational Trip</h2>
<p>It's honestly quite a lol to say this but I really can't say I've seen much of Seoul or South Korea beacuse I spent most of my time crammed in a small classroom in Gangnam (Where the song <i>Gangnam Style</i> is literally based) studying and basically going through boot camp rituals for the SAT exam. </p>
    
<p>I could only do so much, but here are some cool spots I really digged while I was there--aka FOOD. </p>

    <img src="jame.jpg" alt="Jane's Pizza">
  <div class="desc"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Janes-Picky-Pizza/257815574271303">Jane's Picky Pizza</a>is a cute and small pizza shop in Seoul that sells small one person pizzas and serves in cute platters. It's about 3 pizzas for about $20.  </div>

<div class="img">

<div class="desc"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/jiyugaoka.8/">Jiyugaoka 8-Chome</a> is actually quite close to Jane's Picky Pizza and I went there after dinner for some cake. I was immediately hooked to the place because of it's cute outdoor decoration of animal sculptures and bicycles on turf and also because it's named after my hometown in Tokyo! On the left is a strawberry shortcake and on the right is an oreo cake. </div>

<img src="gourmet494.JPG" alt="galleria">
<div class="desc"><a href="http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SHP/SH_EN_7_2.jsp?cid=273773">Galleria Department Store</a> is really iconic and you will easily spot the decadent building in the evening with all of its lights all over the building. I had this steak and rice as a treat yo self dinner after a long week of SAT prep from one of the restaurants in the food court called <i>Gourmet 494</i>, god damn, so so so good!</div>

<div class="desc"><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294197-d7161373-Reviews-Beansbins_Myeongdong-Seoul.html">Beansbins Waffles</a> was pretty much my last meal in Seoul. If you didn't know Asian countries like Japan and South Korea are surprisingly really into waffles and making them epic!!! This order was a strawberry shortcake waffle with crazy amount of strawberry and whipped cream. I'm not much of a sweet tooth but sometimes ya just gota go for it, ya know?</div>
