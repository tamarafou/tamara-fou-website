    <h2><bold>Prague</bold></h2>
    <p>I visited Prague in November of 2014 as my second destination during my fall break with my friend. I don't know about her, but for me personally, Prague was a bit overrated and not my favourite European city. Perhaps I was underprepared or maybe it was something about the weather that put me off. But nonetheless, I can't speak for everyone, so here are some of the things I did!</p>
    
    <h3><bold>Prague Activities</bold></h3>

  <div class="desc">The Old Town Square in central Prague in the evening. Fun fact: NYU Prague is literally located right there! </div>

  <div class="desc">For all you freeloaders like me, you can actually just walk around the vicinity of Prague Castle for free! This is a view looking up at the Cathedral inside the castle.</div>

  <div class="desc">Right behind the Franz Kafka museum (for those who are huge fans of <i>Metamorphisis</i>, there is a small landing by the Danube river. It was actually quite pleasant to see flocks of swans hanging out with the view of Prague behind them. </div>
