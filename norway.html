<h2>A Weekend in Bergen</h2>
    <p>Bergen is located in south west Norway and is a Unesco World Heritage site. It is a beautiful fishing town surrounded by fjords and mountains over mountains. Being here was like a fresh breath of air, and as many locals have told me, apparently the beautiful weather I got to experience is not that common and Bergen is actually known for it's constant rain!</p>
