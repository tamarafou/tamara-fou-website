<h2>Beautiful Bergen</h2>
<div class="img">
    <img src="bryggen.JPG">
    <div class="desc"><h2>Bryggen</h2>Bryggen is the world heritage site and is famous for being such a well preserved part of Bergen. It has pretty much been standing for around 1000 years (obviously restored from time to time) and one can say is probably the icon of Bergen</div></div>

    <div class="desc"><h2>Strandgaten--The Main Street </h2>This is the main street of Bergen where most of the stores are. Bergen is actually a nice college town so you'll see a lot of young people hanging out, as well as families. </div></div>
    
<h2>Fjord Cruise</h2>
<p>I'm usually not one to take tours when I travel--I much prefer walking around but I gotta say, fjord cruises are breathtaking. And how else would you get to these basically desolate places? </p>

<h2>Hiking up Mount Floyen & a bit of Vidden Trail</h2>
<img src="norwaypano.JPG" height="200">
        <p>Hiking to the top of Floyen is a pretty easy hike, just following a road up the mountain that overlooks Bergen. If you are not up for a hike, there is also a funicular that takes you up the mountain in about 5 minutes. </p>
        <p>My friends I wanted to go higher and see more of the landscape, and also we heard about a waffle shop about a mile away, so we followed the Vidden Trail, that takes you to the next mountain Ulriken. We drank hard ciders as we climbed up and it was a leisurely hike to the waffle shop. </p>
    <p>Behold....the waffle shop....so majestic.....<img src="wafflehouse.jpg" width="300"></p>
    <p>We also hiked up a little more after a local woman suggested there's a great view just 20 more minutes walk so we figured why not!</p>
