<h2><bold>Das Berlin</bold></h2>
<p><img src="berlin.JPG" alt="Berlin" width="500" height="700" align="left" /> I got into Berlin groggy and tired from a 6 hour long bus ride from Prague at the last end of my backpacking trip in November 2015. Little did we know, Berlin was celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Berlin Wall coming down and were not prepared for the very historical and somewhat political agenda the city had for us. </p>
