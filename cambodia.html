    <h2>The Best of Siem Reap</h2>
    <p1>
       I visited Siem Reap, Cambodia in December, 2012 with my family. In comparison to Cambodia's capital Phnom Penh, Siem Reap is considered more of the cultural heart of Cambodia and is home to the famous Angkor Wat, which is considered one of the seven wonders of the world!

        If there is one thing you need to do in Siem Reap, it is definitely to see Angkor Wat and its surrounding sites. Angkor Tom was my favourite because of how beautiful the ruins looked wrapped and taken over by many vines and roots.
