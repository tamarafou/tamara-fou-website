    <h2>A Memorable Vacations</h2>
    <p>As cliche as I'm about to sound, Malta was magical. I visited in April but I still had to really toughen up to take a dip in the pool and the beach because it was a bit chilly there but the whole country, which are three very small islands off the coast of southern Italy, has an unexplainable warmth and old school vibe that really felt like time had stopped there. </p>
